# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Issue Response Agent with Automated PR Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an intelligent agent that listens for GitHub issues via webhooks and automatically reproduces, investigates, and fixes issues by submitting linked pull requests
# Details:
Build a comprehensive issue response system that automatically handles GitHub issues through intelligent analysis and automated fixes. The system should: 1) Set up webhook proxy to receive GitHub issue events (opened, updated, labeled), 2) Deploy specialized issue response agents that can analyze issue descriptions and reproduce problems, 3) Implement intelligent issue categorization and routing (bug reports, feature requests, documentation issues), 4) Create automated reproduction environment setup based on issue context, 5) Build investigation and debugging capabilities using available tools and codebase analysis, 6) Implement automated fix generation with proper testing and validation, 7) Create pull request generation with detailed descriptions linking back to the original issue, 8) Include automated testing and CI integration for generated fixes, 9) Add issue status tracking and communication back to issue reporters, 10) Implement escalation mechanisms for complex issues that require human intervention. This will significantly reduce response time for issues and provide consistent, high-quality automated fixes.
