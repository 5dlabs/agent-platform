# Task ID: 15
# Title: Optimize GitHub Actions Performance and ARC Runner Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve GitHub Actions performance through container staging and optimize ARC runner usage to reduce costs and resource consumption
# Details:
Comprehensive optimization of the CI/CD pipeline to improve performance and reduce costs. The system should: 1) Create pre-staged container images with all required tools and dependencies to speed up GitHub Actions execution time, 2) Migrate all GitHub Actions workflows to use ARC (Actions Runner Controller) runners instead of GitHub-hosted runners to save GitHub credits, 3) Investigate current ARC runner deployment and identify why multiple runners are running simultaneously, 4) Implement proper ARC runner scaling and resource management to prevent over-provisioning, 5) Create monitoring and alerting for runner usage and costs, 6) Optimize workflow parallelization and caching strategies, 7) Implement runner cleanup and lifecycle management, 8) Create cost analysis and reporting for runner usage. This maintenance task will significantly reduce CI/CD costs and improve build performance while ensuring efficient resource utilization.
