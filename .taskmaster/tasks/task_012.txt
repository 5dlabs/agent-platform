# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement PR Automation with Gemini CLI Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create GitHub webhook system that automatically deploys Gemini CLI agents when pull requests are created to convert codebase to Markdown for review
# Details:
Build a comprehensive PR automation system that integrates with GitHub webhooks and deploys Gemini CLI agents automatically. The system should: 1) Create GitHub webhook handler for PR events (opened, updated, synchronized), 2) Deploy Gemini CLI agent to the same workspace as the PR with access to the full codebase, 3) Configure Gemini agent to convert the entire codebase into structured Markdown files for easy review, 4) Set up Anthropic hooks integration for seamless workflow automation, 5) Ensure Gemini agent has access to PR diff and can provide contextual analysis of changes, 6) Generate comprehensive Markdown documentation that highlights changes and provides review guidance, 7) Store generated documentation in a reviewable format (GitHub comments, artifacts, or separate repository), 8) Include automated cleanup of resources after PR completion. This will streamline the code review process by providing AI-powered analysis and documentation generation automatically on every PR.
