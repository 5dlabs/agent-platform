# Task Implementation Instructions

You are testing the orchestrator system. Please perform the following actions:

## 1. Verify Current Environment
- Print your current working directory (`pwd`)
- List all files in `/workspace/` 
- Check if you're in a git repository (`git status`)
- Verify GitHub authentication (`git remote -v`)
- Check current branch (`git branch`)

## 2. Document Your Findings
Create a file named `test-results-task-9999.md` with:
- Timestamp of the test
- Your observations about:
  - Working directory location
  - File structure (what files exist where)
  - Git repository status
  - GitHub remote configuration
  - Current branch name
  - Any errors or issues encountered
  - Whether the subPath mounting worked correctly

## 3. Create Full Workspace Snapshot
Create a file named `workspace-snapshot.md` that shows:
- Output of `find . -type f -name "*.md" | head -20`
- Output of `ls -la`
- Content of `.claude.json`
- Any other relevant workspace information

## 4. Create Feature Branch and Commit
- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b test/task-9999-workspace-verification`
- Stage ALL files: `git add -A`
- Commit with message: "Add test results for task 9999 - workspace verification"
- Note: Session export files will be created automatically when the task completes

## 5. Create Pull Request
- Push the branch: `git push origin test/task-9999-workspace-verification`
- Create a PR using: `gh pr create --title "Test Task 9999: Workspace Verification" --body "This PR contains the test results and workspace snapshot from task 9999 verification."`

## 6. Report Success
Confirm:
- Files were created
- Branch was created from 'main' (not 'master')
- All files were committed
- PR was created successfully
- Provide the PR URL

This is a test to ensure our new simplified authentication and subPath mounting are working correctly.
