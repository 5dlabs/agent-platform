# Acceptance Criteria: API Rate Limiting

## Overview

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the API Rate Limiting system implementation. All criteria must be met for the task to be considered complete.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Rate Limiting Algorithms

#### AC-1.1: Sliding Window Algorithm
- **Given** a sliding window rate limiter is configured with 100 requests per minute
- **When** requests are made within the time window
- **Then** the system should accurately count requests within the sliding window
- **And** should allow requests when under the limit and block when over

#### AC-1.2: Fixed Window Algorithm
- **Given** a fixed window rate limiter is configured with 100 requests per minute
- **When** requests are made within fixed time intervals
- **Then** the system should reset counters at the beginning of each window
- **And** should accurately enforce limits within each window

#### AC-1.3: Token Bucket Algorithm
- **Given** a token bucket rate limiter is configured with 100 tokens and 10 refill rate
- **When** requests consume tokens from the bucket
- **Then** the system should allow burst traffic up to bucket capacity
- **And** should refill tokens at the specified rate

#### AC-1.4: Algorithm Accuracy
- **Given** any rate limiting algorithm is in use
- **When** requests are processed under normal conditions
- **Then** the count accuracy should be within 1% of actual requests
- **And** should handle edge cases like concurrent requests correctly

### 2. Policy Management

#### AC-2.1: Policy Creation
- **Given** an administrator creates a new rate limit policy
- **When** the policy is submitted with valid configuration
- **Then** the policy should be stored and become active immediately
- **And** should be applied to matching requests

#### AC-2.2: Policy Validation
- **Given** an invalid policy configuration is submitted
- **When** the policy is validated
- **Then** appropriate validation errors should be returned
- **And** the policy should not be created or applied

#### AC-2.3: Policy Priority
- **Given** multiple policies match a request
- **When** rate limits are evaluated
- **Then** the policy with the highest priority should be applied
- **And** lower priority policies should be ignored

#### AC-2.4: Policy Updates
- **Given** an existing policy is updated
- **When** the changes are saved
- **Then** the new configuration should take effect within 60 seconds
- **And** should not affect existing rate limit counters

### 3. Condition Matching

#### AC-3.1: User Tier Matching
- **Given** a policy is configured for premium users
- **When** a premium user makes a request
- **Then** the premium policy should be applied
- **And** other user tiers should use different policies

#### AC-3.2: Endpoint Matching
- **Given** a policy is configured for specific endpoints using patterns
- **When** a request is made to a matching endpoint
- **Then** the endpoint-specific policy should be applied
- **And** non-matching endpoints should use default policies

#### AC-3.3: HTTP Method Matching
- **Given** a policy is configured for specific HTTP methods
- **When** a request is made with a matching method
- **Then** the method-specific policy should be applied
- **And** other methods should use different policies

#### AC-3.4: IP Range Matching
- **Given** a policy is configured for specific IP ranges
- **When** a request is made from a matching IP
- **Then** the IP-specific policy should be applied
- **And** IPs outside the range should use different policies

### 4. Rate Limit Enforcement

#### AC-4.1: Request Blocking
- **Given** a request exceeds the configured rate limit
- **When** the request is processed
- **Then** it should be blocked with HTTP 429 status code
- **And** should include appropriate rate limit headers

#### AC-4.2: Request Allowing
- **Given** a request is within the configured rate limit
- **When** the request is processed
- **Then** it should be allowed to proceed
- **And** should include rate limit headers with remaining quota

#### AC-4.3: Multiple Window Enforcement
- **Given** a policy has multiple time windows (per minute, per hour)
- **When** any window limit is exceeded
- **Then** the request should be blocked
- **And** should specify which window was exceeded

#### AC-4.4: Bypass Mechanisms
- **Given** a request should bypass rate limiting (admin user, internal service)
- **When** the bypass conditions are met
- **Then** the request should be allowed without rate limit checks
- **And** should not affect rate limit counters

### 5. HTTP Response Headers

#### AC-5.1: Rate Limit Headers
- **Given** a request is processed by the rate limiter
- **When** the response is sent
- **Then** it should include standard rate limit headers:
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The rate limit ceiling
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining quota in current window
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when quota resets

#### AC-5.2: Retry-After Header
- **Given** a request is rate limited
- **When** the 429 response is sent
- **Then** it should include `Retry-After` header
- **And** should specify seconds until next allowed request

#### AC-5.3: Policy Identification
