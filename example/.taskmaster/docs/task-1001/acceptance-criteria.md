# Acceptance Criteria: User Authentication System

## Overview

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the User Authentication System implementation. All criteria must be met for the task to be considered complete.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Registration

#### AC-1.1: Basic Registration
- **Given** a user provides valid registration data (email, password, firstName, lastName)
- **When** they submit a registration request
- **Then** the system should create a new user account and send a verification email
- **And** the user should receive a successful registration response

#### AC-1.2: Email Validation
- **Given** a user provides an invalid email format
- **When** they submit a registration request
- **Then** the system should return a validation error with appropriate message

#### AC-1.3: Password Strength Validation
- **Given** a user provides a weak password (less than 8 characters, missing complexity)
- **When** they submit a registration request
- **Then** the system should return a validation error with password requirements

#### AC-1.4: Duplicate Email Prevention
- **Given** a user attempts to register with an already existing email
- **When** they submit a registration request
- **Then** the system should return an error indicating the email is already in use

#### AC-1.5: Email Verification
- **Given** a user receives a verification email
- **When** they click the verification link
- **Then** their email should be marked as verified in the system
- **And** they should be able to log in

### 2. User Login

#### AC-2.1: Successful Login
- **Given** a user provides valid credentials (verified email and correct password)
- **When** they submit a login request
- **Then** the system should authenticate the user and return JWT tokens
- **And** the tokens should contain user information and permissions

#### AC-2.2: Invalid Credentials
- **Given** a user provides invalid credentials
- **When** they submit a login request
- **Then** the system should return an authentication error
- **And** the failed attempt should be logged

#### AC-2.3: Unverified Email
- **Given** a user has not verified their email
- **When** they attempt to log in
- **Then** the system should return an error requiring email verification

#### AC-2.4: Account Lockout
- **Given** a user has made 5 consecutive failed login attempts
- **When** they attempt to log in again
- **Then** the account should be locked for 30 minutes
- **And** further login attempts should be rejected with appropriate message

### 3. Token Management

#### AC-3.1: JWT Token Generation
- **Given** a user successfully logs in
- **When** authentication is complete
- **Then** the system should generate both access and refresh tokens
- **And** tokens should be properly signed with RS256 algorithm
- **And** tokens should contain correct user information and permissions

#### AC-3.2: Token Validation
- **Given** a user makes a request with a valid JWT token
- **When** the request is processed
- **Then** the system should validate the token and allow access
- **And** user context should be available in the request

#### AC-3.3: Token Expiration
- **Given** a user makes a request with an expired token
- **When** the token is validated
- **Then** the system should reject the request with appropriate error

#### AC-3.4: Token Refresh
- **Given** a user provides a valid refresh token
- **When** they request a new access token
- **Then** the system should generate a new access token
- **And** the refresh token should remain valid until its expiration

### 4. Role-Based Access Control

#### AC-4.1: Permission Checking
- **Given** a user has specific permissions
- **When** they access a protected resource
- **Then** the system should verify their permissions
- **And** allow access only if permissions are sufficient

#### AC-4.2: Role Assignment
- **Given** an admin assigns a role to a user
- **When** the assignment is made
- **Then** the user should receive all permissions associated with that role
- **And** the assignment should be logged in audit trail

#### AC-4.3: Permission Inheritance
- **Given** a user has multiple roles
- **When** permissions are calculated
- **Then** the user should have all permissions from all assigned roles

### 5. Security Features

#### AC-5.1: Password Hashing
- **Given** a user's password is stored
- **When** the password is saved to database
- **Then** it should be hashed using bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds
- **And** the plain text password should never be stored

#### AC-5.2: Rate Limiting
- **Given** excessive requests from a single IP
- **When** rate limits are exceeded
- **Then** the system should temporarily block further requests
- **And** return appropriate rate limit error

#### AC-5.3: Account Lockout
- **Given** multiple failed login attempts
- **When** the threshold is reached
- **Then** the account should be locked temporarily
- **And** lockout should be logged for security monitoring

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 6. Performance

#### AC-6.1: Response Time
- **Given** authentication requests under normal load
- **When** the system processes requests
- **Then** response time should be less than 200ms for 95% of requests

#### AC-6.2: Concurrent Users
- **Given** multiple users logging in simultaneously
- **When** the system handles concurrent requests
- **Then** it should support at least 1000 concurrent authentication requests

### 7. Security

#### AC-7.1: Data Protection
- **Given** sensitive user data is transmitted
- **When** data is sent over the network
- **Then** all communication should use HTTPS/TLS encryption

#### AC-7.2: Token Security
- **Given** JWT tokens are issued
- **When** tokens are created
- **Then** they should be signed with secure algorithms (RS256)
- **And** should include appropriate claims and expiration times

#### AC-7.3: Input Validation
- **Given** user input is received
- **When** the system processes the input
- **Then** all input should be validated and sanitized
- **And** SQL injection and XSS attacks should be prevented

### 8. Audit and Monitoring

#### AC-8.1: Audit Trail
- **Given** authentication events occur
- **When** events are processed
- **Then** they should be logged with appropriate details
- **And** logs should include user ID, action, timestamp, and IP address

#### AC-8.2: Security Monitoring
- **Given** suspicious activities occur
- **When** the system detects anomalies
- **Then** security events should be logged and monitored
- **And** alerts should be generated for critical events
