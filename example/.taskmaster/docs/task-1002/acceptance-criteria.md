# Acceptance Criteria: Real-time Notification System

## Overview

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the Real-time Notification System implementation. All criteria must be met for the task to be considered complete.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. WebSocket Infrastructure

#### AC-1.1: WebSocket Server Setup
- **Given** the notification system is deployed
- **When** a client attempts to connect to the WebSocket server
- **Then** the server should accept the connection with proper authentication
- **And** the connection should be maintained with heartbeat/ping-pong mechanism

#### AC-1.2: Connection Authentication
- **Given** a client connects to the WebSocket server
- **When** they provide a valid JWT token
- **Then** the connection should be authenticated and user context established
- **And** the user should be joined to their personal notification room

#### AC-1.3: Connection Management
- **Given** multiple clients connect to the WebSocket server
- **When** the server manages these connections
- **Then** each connection should be tracked with user ID and metadata
- **And** stale connections should be cleaned up automatically

#### AC-1.4: Room-based Messaging
- **Given** a user is connected to the WebSocket server
- **When** they subscribe to specific notification channels
- **Then** they should be added to the appropriate rooms
- **And** messages should be delivered only to subscribed channels

### 2. Real-time Notification Delivery

#### AC-2.1: Instant Notification Delivery
- **Given** a notification is created for a user
- **When** the user is connected via WebSocket
- **Then** the notification should be delivered in real-time (< 100ms)
- **And** the notification should include all required fields (id, type, title, message, priority, timestamp)

#### AC-2.2: Offline User Handling
- **Given** a notification is created for a user
- **When** the user is not connected via WebSocket
- **Then** the notification should be queued for delivery
- **And** should be delivered when the user reconnects

#### AC-2.3: Message Broadcasting
- **Given** a system-wide notification is created
- **When** it needs to be delivered to all users
- **Then** it should be broadcast to all connected clients
- **And** should respect individual user preferences

#### AC-2.4: Channel-based Delivery
- **Given** a notification is created for a specific channel
- **When** users are subscribed to that channel
- **Then** only subscribed users should receive the notification
- **And** unsubscribed users should not receive it

### 3. Multi-Channel Notification Support

#### AC-3.1: In-App Notifications
- **Given** a user has in-app notifications enabled

### 4. User Preference Management

#### AC-4.1: Global Preferences
- **Given** a user accesses their notification preferences
- **When** they update global settings (email, push, in-app)
- **Then** the preferences should be saved and applied immediately
- **And** should affect all future notifications

#### AC-4.2: Channel-specific Preferences
- **Given** a user wants to customize notifications per channel
- **When** they set different preferences for different channels
- **Then** each channel should respect its specific settings

#### AC-4.3: Notification Type Preferences
- **Given** a user wants to control specific notification types
- **When** they disable certain types (e.g., marketing, system updates)
- **Then** those types should not be delivered to the user
- **And** should be filtered at the processing stage

#### AC-4.4: Quiet Hours
- **Given** a user sets quiet hours in their preferences
