# Documentation Generation Failure

## Command Attempted
`orchestrator task init-docs --model opus --force`

## Output and Error
```
Initializing documentation generator...
Repository: https://github.com/5dlabs/agent-platform.git
Working directory: example
Source branch: main
Target branch: main
Submitting documentation generation job...
Failed to submit documentation generation job: Failed to send documentation generation request
```

## Possible Causes
- Incorrect repository configuration (it's pointing to https://github.com/5dlabs/agent-platform.git, which may not be the intended repo for this example).
- Missing authentication or API keys for submitting the job.
- Network issues or service unavailability.
- The orchestrator CLI might require additional setup or flags specific to this project.

## Impact
This prevents completion of Phase 2 in the workflow, as the documentation generation job could not be submitted.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Verify the repository URL and branch settings in the orchestrator configuration.
- Check if there are any required environment variables or config files missing.
- Test the CLI with verbose logging if available to get more details on the failure.
